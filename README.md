# Prework-Study-Guide


## Description
  This study guide is for me and anyone else studying programming languages to store information that is used in creating webpages. 

## Installation
  N/A

## Usage
  Each section has information pertaining to a specific part of webpage construction. 
  Text written in bold is the name of the information for easy lookup on Google.
  For JavaScript, the information only runs on the console, not on the physical webpage.
    To open the console, use Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows) to jump straight to the Console in the inspect option.
    You will see a list of topics we learned in the console. It will also suggest a random topic to study for you!
